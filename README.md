This is the project from MIT open course.

You can learn the basics of an operating system from this course, I finished
this project in 2008. In recent years, this course has changed a lot and
several other new projects (e.g. network driver) are added. But I haven't got
enough time to update this repository. However, the memory management,
filesystem almost remain intact.
